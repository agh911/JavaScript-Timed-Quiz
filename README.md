# Challenge 06 Working with Web APIs: Code Quiz



## Description

For this project it was asked to create a code quiz that features multiple choice questions and prompts users to save their scores based on either completion or time. Aditionally, the highscores had to be saved into local storage to display in a given window session.

The quiz needed to check for the following: 
* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
